analyze the attached repo. let me know once you're ready to continue as per the phase_1_status.md accordingly.

from here onwards, be sure not to break existing functionality and only make small implementation step one at a time, wait for me to check for errors in every small step before moving on.

i've implemented the changes and found no errors

please update the `phase_1_ststus.md` file, accordingly
