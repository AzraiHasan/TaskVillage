analyze the project against the masterplan. let's continue developing this PoC locally first, and take advantage of Nuxt 3 built-in server/ folder powered by nitro to handle backend stuff. for security and authentication, we can use Nuxt's built-in state management. we don't need useStorage right now. Our current Pinia implementation should provide everything we need for the PoC phase.

please create a new implementation plan that carefully preserves the existing codebase and functionality while allowing us to move forward with development.
