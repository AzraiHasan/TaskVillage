# Authentication Testing & Security Hardening Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive approach to testing and hardening the authentication system. Security is critical for any authentication system, and thorough testing ensures reliability across different scenarios and edge cases.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Password Strength Requirements - Implemented
- ‚è≥ Rate Limiting for Auth Endpoints - Not started
- ‚è≥ Authentication Event Logging - Not started
- ‚úÖ Security Headers - Implemented
- ‚è≥ Basic Authentication Flow Tests - Not started
- ‚è≥ Security Audits - Not started

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Comprehensive Authentication Flow Tests ‚è≥

#### Implementation Details
- **Unit Tests**
  - Test validation logic for login/register forms
  - Test password hashing and verification
  - Test CSRF token generation and validation
  - Test session management functions
  
- **Integration Tests**
  - Test registration with valid/invalid data
  - Test login with correct/incorrect credentials
  - Test session persistence and expiration
  - Test logout functionality
  
- **End-to-End Tests**
  - Complete registration ‚Üí login ‚Üí protected page access flow
  - Session expiration and renewal behavior
  - Remember me functionality
  - Password reset flow

#### Success Criteria
- All tests pass in development and CI environments
- Edge cases properly handled (expired tokens, invalid inputs, etc.)
- Test coverage of at least 80% for authentication components

### 2. Rate Limiting for Auth Endpoints üîÑ

#### Implementation Details
- Implement IP-based rate limiting for sensitive endpoints:
  - `/api/login`: 5 attempts per 5 minutes
  - `/api/register`: 3 attempts per 10 minutes
  - `/api/password-reset`: 3 attempts per hour
  
- Add dynamic rate limiting that increases lockout duration after multiple failures
- Implement separate limits for API vs UI requests

#### Code Implementation
```typescript
// server/middleware/rate-limit.ts
import { defineEventHandler, createError } from 'h3'
import { rateLimit } from '~/server/utils/rate-limit'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const path = getRequestPath(event)
  
  // Apply rate limiting only to auth endpoints
  if (path.startsWith('/api/login') || path.startsWith('/api/register')) {
    const ip = getRequestIP(event)
    const key = `${ip}:${path}`
    
    const limit = path.includes('login') ? 5 : 3
    const windowMs = path.includes('login') ? 5 * 60 * 1000 : 10 * 60 * 1000
    
    const allowed = await rateLimit(key, limit, windowMs)
    
    if (!allowed) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 429,
        message: 'Too many requests, please try again later'
      })
    }
  }
})
```

#### Success Criteria
- Successfully blocks rapid repeated login attempts
- Returns appropriate status codes and friendly error messages
- Does not restrict legitimate users
- Prevents brute force attacks

### 3. Security Headers ‚úÖ

- Already implemented in `nuxt.config.ts` and security middleware
- Current headers include:
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Permissions-Policy

### 4. Security Audits

#### Implementation Details
- **Static Code Analysis**
  - Run security-focused linting rules
  - Use automated tools to detect common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
  
- **Dependency Scanning**
  - Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
  - Implement automated updates for security patches
  
- **Manual Code Review**
  - Focus on authentication flow and session management
  - Review password handling and storage
  - Check for proper input validation
  
- **Penetration Testing**
  - Test for session hijacking vulnerabilities
  - Attempt CSRF attacks
  - Test for XSS vulnerabilities in auth-related pages

#### Success Criteria
- Zero critical or high security issues
- All medium issues have mitigation plans
- Security scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### 5. Authentication Event Logging

#### Implementation Details
- Log authentication-related events:
  - Login attempts (success/failure)
  - Registration events
  - Password changes
  - Session invalidation
  - Account lockouts
  
- Include relevant data for each event:
  - Timestamp
  - User ID (if applicable)
  - IP address
  - User agent
  - Success/failure status
  - Failure reason (if applicable)
  
- Implement proper log rotation and retention policies

#### Code Implementation
```typescript
// server/utils/auth-logger.ts
export interface AuthEvent {
  type: 'login' | 'register' | 'logout' | 'password_change' | 'password_reset' | 'lockout';
  userId?: string;
  success: boolean;
  failureReason?: string;
  ip: string;
  userAgent: string;
}

export async function logAuthEvent(event: AuthEvent): Promise<void> {
  // Log to file in production, console in development
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  const logEntry = {
    timestamp,
    ...event
  };
  
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    // In production, write to secure log file
    // This would integrate with a logging service in a real app
    console.log(`AUTH EVENT: ${JSON.stringify(logEntry)}`);
  } else {
    // In development, log to console
    console.log(`AUTH EVENT: ${JSON.stringify(logEntry)}`);
  }
}
```

#### Success Criteria
- All significant auth events are properly logged
- Logs contain sufficient information for security analysis
- No sensitive data (passwords) in logs
- Logs are properly secured and retained

### 6. Password Strength Requirements ‚úÖ

#### Implementation Details
- ‚úÖ Implemented password strength validation:
  - ‚úÖ Minimum length (10+ characters)
  - ‚úÖ Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
  - ‚úÖ Common password check
  - ‚ùå Context-specific password check (no username in password) - deferred
  
- ‚úÖ Added visual password strength meter with feedback
- ‚ùå Prevent password reuse during resets - to be implemented

#### Code Implementation
```typescript
// Password strength validation schema (implemented in password-validation.ts)
export const createPasswordSchema = () => {
  return z.string()
    .min(10, 'Password must be at least 10 characters')
    .refine(
      password => /[A-Z]/.test(password),
      'Password must contain at least one uppercase letter'
    )
    .refine(
      password => /[a-z]/.test(password),
      'Password must contain at least one lowercase letter'
    )
    .refine(
      password => /[0-9]/.test(password),
      'Password must contain at least one number'
    )
    .refine(
      password => /[^A-Za-z0-9]/.test(password),
      'Password must contain at least one special character'
    )
    .refine(
      password => !COMMON_PASSWORDS.includes(password.toLowerCase()),
      'This password is too common and easily guessed'
    );
};
```

#### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Users can only create strong passwords
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback helps users create stronger passwords
- ‚úÖ Password requirements are clearly communicated to users
- ‚è≥ No significant increase in registration abandonment - to be monitored

## Prioritization & Timeline

### Immediate Priority (1-2 weeks)
1. **Password Strength Requirements** - Directly improves security
2. **Rate Limiting for Auth Endpoints** - Protects against brute force attacks
3. **Authentication Event Logging** - Enables security monitoring

### Medium Priority (2-4 weeks)
1. **Basic Authentication Flow Tests** - Ensures current functionality works
2. **Initial Security Audit** - Identifies critical issues

### Longer Term (1-2 months)
1. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Adds complete test coverage
2. **Advanced Security Audits** - In-depth security review
3. **Penetration Testing** - Verifies real-world security

## Conclusion
Implementing these security measures will significantly enhance the authentication system's protection against common attacks while ensuring a good user experience. Regular testing and auditing will maintain this security posture as the application evolves.
