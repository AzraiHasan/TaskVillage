  - Explore trending tasks in workspace
  - Discover tasks by topic/tag

### Next Steps Priority
1. **Authentication System**:
   - Implement proper user authentication
   - Session management
   - User registration and profiles

2. **Following System**:

   - Aggregate actions by user
   - Support filtering by activity type

4. **Mentions and Tagging**:
   - Implement @mentions parser
   - Create clickable user tags
   - Add notification triggers for mentions

5. **Rich User Profiles**:
   - Design enhanced profile pages
   - Add activity history
   - Show task contribution metrics

## Authentication Implementation Approach

Based on the "Nuxt Auth Utils Example" document, we'll implement authentication using the `nuxt-auth-utils` module with the following approach:

### 1. Setup Authentication Infrastructure ✅
- Install the `nuxt-auth-utils` module ✅
- Configure session password environment variable ✅
- Utilize sealed cookies for session storage ✅

### 2. Implement Core Authentication Endpoints 🔄
- Create login API route with email/password validation ✅
- Implement registration endpoint for new accounts ❌
- Add logout functionality to clear sessions ❌

### 3. Create Authentication UI Components 🔄
- Develop proper login form with validation ✅
- Create registration page with necessary inputs ❌
- Enhance user profile component to use real data ❌

### 4. Secure Routes and API Endpoints
- Update auth middleware with proper authentication checks
- Use `requireUserSession` for protected server routes
- Implement client-side protection for sensitive pages

### 5. Update Existing Components
- Integrate task management with authenticated user data
- Update notification system to target real users
- Replace mock user implementation with actual authentication

### 6. User State Management
- Implement session persistence
- Store and manage user preferences

### Optional Enhancements
- Add OAuth support for social logins
- Implement WebAuthn/Passkey for passwordless authentication

## Upcoming Phases

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)

- Performance metrics
- Time tracking features
- Role-based access control
- Team collaboration tools

### Phase 4: Enhancement (Planned)
- Performance optimization
- Advanced caching
- UI/UX refinements
- Mobile responsiveness
- Integration capabilities
