# Looking at our current implementation, we have successfully:

- Set up the basic task management features
- Implemented workspace management
- Created the UI components with Nuxt UI
- Added error handling across components
- Established state management with Pinia

# Our error handling implementation is now robust, covering:

- Type-safe error classes and codes
- Component-level error boundaries
- Store-level error management
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper error propagation

# The next logical step would be to complete Phase 1 by focusing on comprehensive testing of our error handling system. We could adopt a hybrid approach where we:

- Identify critical error scenarios that would be much harder to fix later (like workspace permission errors, race conditions, and state synchronization, etc.)
- Ensure those specific areas are well-handled
- Move forward with social features while being mindful of error handling needs
- Refine error handling iteratively as we discover edge cases

# we should at minimum ensure our error handling is solid for:

- Workspace access control
- Task visibility changes
- User permission checks
- Basic state consistency

## Before moving to Phase 2 (social features), we need to ensure our error handling works correctly across all existing features. This means testing:

# Task Creation Flow:

- Create tasks with invalid data
- Attempt to create tasks in unauthorized workspaces
- Test workspace access validation
- Verify error message display

# Task Management Flow:

- Update task status with invalid values
- Test progress updates outside allowed ranges
- Verify workspace access checks
- Confirm error handling in the UI

# Workspace Management:

- Switch between workspaces with invalid permissions
- Test workspace access denial scenarios
- Verify error propagation to the UI

# Component Integration:

- Test error boundary component behavior
- Verify toast notification system
- Ensure form validation works with error handling
