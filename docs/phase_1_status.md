# Phase 1 Status

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ **Task Creation Issue**: Fixed the "Create Task" button functionality 
  - Root cause: Workspace selection in `TaskForm.vue` was using a one-way computed property with `v-model`
  - Solution: Implemented a two-way binding for the workspace selection with getter/setter

- ✅ **Workspace Filtering Issue**: Fixed tasks appearing in incorrect workspaces
  - Root cause: Task filtering in store only filtered by type (public/private), not by workspace
  - Solution: Updated `publicTasks` and `privateTasks` getters in `useTaskStore.ts` to filter by both type and workspace

## Remaining Issues
- Development user initialized 3 times in console, but doesn't reflect in UI
  - Potential cause: Multiple initialization in component lifecycles
  - Next step: Review initialization logic in `app.vue` and related components

## Current Implementation Status
We have successfully:
- Set up the basic task management features
- Implemented workspace management with proper isolation
- Created the UI components with Nuxt UI
- Added error handling across components 
- Established state management with Pinia
- Fixed critical issues in the task creation workflow

## Error Handling Status
Our error handling implementation is robust, covering:
- Type-safe error classes and codes
- Component-level error boundaries
- Store-level error management
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper error propagation

## Next Steps Before Phase 2
- Fix the remaining issue with development user initialization
- Test all error handling scenarios thoroughly:
  - Workspace access control
  - Task visibility changes
  - User permission checks
  - Basic state consistency
- Complete comprehensive testing of existing features
- Validate all fixes align with the masterplan requirements
